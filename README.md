## Next.js Tutorial 

After working with NextJS for the last 18 months, I decided to sit down and actually complete their tutorial on setting up a front-end app for the learning experience and to get up to date on the newest features.

This tutorial has you build a basic invoice tracking system. The tutorial covers building the dashboard and invoice pages, as well as routes and functions for creating and updating invoices. I also took it upon myself to add the customers listing page and routes/functions for creating and updating customers as extra practice.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js website.
