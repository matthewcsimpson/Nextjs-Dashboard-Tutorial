## Next.js Tutorial

This tutorial has you build a basic invoice tracking system. The tutorial covers building the dashboard and invoice pages, as well as routes and functions for creating and updating invoices. I also took it upon myself to add the customers listing page and routes/functions for creating and updating customers as extra practice.
