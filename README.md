## Next.js Tutorial 

After working with NextJS for the last 18 months I decided to sit down and actually complet their tutorial on setting up a front end app, for the learning experience and to get up to date on the neweest features.  

This tutorial has you build a basic invoice tracking system.  The tutorial has you build the dashboard and invoice pages, as well as routes/functions for creating and updating invoices.  I also took it upon myself to add the customers listing page, and routes/functions for creating and updating customers as extra practice. 

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.
